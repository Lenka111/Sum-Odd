# Sum-Odd
Sum of all odd numbers
sumOdd() method  has 2 int parameters start and end that represent a range of numbers. The method
should use a for loop to sum up all odd numbers in that range including the end and return the sum.
It should call method isOdd to check if each number is odd.
Example input/output:

* sumOdd(1, 100); → should return 2500

* sumOdd(-1, 100); →  should return -1

* sumOdd(100, 100); → should return 0

* sumOdd(13, 13); → should return 13 (This set contains one number, 13, and it is odd)

* sumOdd(100, -100); → should return -1

* sumOdd(100, 1000); → should return 247500
